and then ask why someone who knows how to code, will understand how to write perfect/performant/secure code on the fly.
Ask yourself why you would want to hire someone to write perfect/performant/secure code.

Next ask yourself why you would also subject such a candidate to complete fizz-buzz questions:

Many people code and many people understand performant code, but how do you protect yourself from what you could not expect?
Anyone concerned about all three, might not have a quick FizzBuzz answer for you, because you have stumped them, asking them 
to write code in a haphazard, insane, risky fashion. Not everyone acheives the same result in the same way.

The Cure? Take off your own blinders and make a few mistakes. If you care about what people think, as well as the above, 
you are a lost cause. Fear is the mind killer, unleash your brain and stick fear in the toilet. Today's coders are Mad Scientists,
so let's set your coding game on fire, and have a public debate about your skills. Matter of fact lets rap about it while were lighting 
your last NDA on fire.
