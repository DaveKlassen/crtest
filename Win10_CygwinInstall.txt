You might want to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux because you heard it worked well...
I did that and found that terminal processing was horrible in remote ssh sessions, and wished for the days of cygwin...
However I also ran into problems installing Cygwin on Windows 10.
Here is what I did to make it work:

Start the Cygwin setup and Download all the cygwin packages you want...
Install Strawberry Perl... and place it's Perl/bin first in path,
Next in path is cygwin...

Install cygwin from the downloads already completed.
Make sure to over-write /bin/perl.exe to point to the stawberry perl version.
    This must be done during the install
    But after perl is installed by the installer...
    And before the post-install scripts get run.
If you don't follow these steps the Cygwin install will loop for infinitum.
I used strace to figure out what was going on (But not enough solve the Perl issues).

The install should execute fine, provided the above occured.
Now its all installed...

How to get shell: 
	copy the cygwin.bat file to a new file and remove the --login flag

Use this new .bat file to start a Cygwin bash shell.

Update bash completion (Since it is now broken):
	vi /etc/bash_completion.d/zzz-fzf
add these lines:

$ diff /etc/bash_completion.d/zzz-fzf zzz-fzf
279,283d278

<   cmd="${cmd//-/_}"
